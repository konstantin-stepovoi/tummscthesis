1) TITEL IN GENERAL: Genetically encoded and evolutionable spin sensors

2) POSSIBLE BASES: LOV domains, Cryptochromes, [YFP, MFP, GFP], porfirins, Nanoparticles - anything which produces electron pairs

3) FIRST SUBTOPIC: ODMR on these systems, optical effects based on e spins driven by magnetic resonance

4) 2nd AND MORE IMP SUBTOPIC: Chemical yield driven by magnetic resonance - key for bio applications

5) PLAN:
	- review to choose which type of chemical is more convenient to build on
	- design a droplet - based screening system
	- start a directed evolution on the chosen chemical using the maid system
